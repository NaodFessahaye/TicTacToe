Created a tictactoe program using C++. This C++ project aims to develop a user-friendly Tic-Tac-Toe game offering both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer modes. The game incorporates a simple 3x3 grid interface with graphical markers for players and emphasizes winning combinations. Users can input their moves using coordinate notation (e.g., A1 or B2), and the system ensures the validity of inputs for a seamless gaming experience. Specifically, an algorithm has been implemented in Player vs Computer mode to enhance the computer's strategy, aiming for a more competitive gameplay experience. The computer's algorithm is designed to make strategic moves to win the game.
